## Recent Implementation Changes

- August 15, 2025. Codebase Cleanup and Optimization: Removed unused and obsolete files to optimize project structure and reduce maintenance overhead. Deleted entire `/api` directory containing Vercel-specific endpoints (build-apk.ts, github/push-batch.ts, sage chat handlers, ai/chat.ts), removed `vite.config.vercel.ts`, `vercel.json`, and `build-vercel.js` deployment configs, cleaned up `attached_assets` directory with numerous development screenshots and temporary images, removed unused service worker `/client/public/sw.js`, and deleted temporary backup files. Fixed port conflict issue preventing server startup by restarting workflow. Project now runs cleanly with focused Replit-specific architecture eliminating Vercel deployment artifacts.
- August 14, 2025. Blockchain-Integrated Decision System Implementation: Built comprehensive daily decision system for Wealth Sprint featuring unique scenarios across 10 categories (real estate, business, transport, technology, lifestyle, unexpected events, partnerships, investments, relationships, support systems).

Created 100% unique decision scenarios for first 10 days covering realistic financial and personal challenges with specific consequences affecting player stats (emotion, stress, karma, logic, reputation, energy) and financial data. Built blockchain simulation system for storing decision hashes with IPFS integration placeholder. Features modern UI with modal decision cards showing "About — Day X" labels, clean option selection with radio buttons, comprehensive result screens with consequence visualization, and incremental stat updates.
