Added sector status display showing current employee assignments with income boost percentages, fixed experience display to show "0 year" in single row format, created new "Team Performance" section with comprehensive employee performance metrics including sector roles, monthly contributions, company growth impact, and detailed performance tracking. Integrated navigation between Team Performance and Team Management sections, enabling seamless workflow from viewing performance to managing assignments and hiring.
- August 10, 2025. Created Sector-Specific Team Management: Removed global team performance overview and unassigned member displays from business sector Team tabs. Built new SectorTeamSection component that shows only employees assigned to specific sectors (e.g., Fast Food sector shows only Fast Food employees). Each business sector now has its own dedicated Team tab displaying sector-specific metrics: team size, average performance, monthly contribution, and detailed employee cards with sector-specific roles and performance data. This provides focused team management per sector, eliminating cross-sector confusion and enabling targeted sector workforce optimization.
