Wealth Sprint – Game Logic Expansion & Polishing v7.0)

🔧 PROJECT: Wealth Sprint — Realistic Simulation & Game Completion Prompt

You are enhancing a financial strategy game with deep simulation and emotional logic.  
Below are the final set of **real-world rules**, **stress/emotion systems**, **team dynamics**, and **failure scenarios** that must be implemented.

Follow this exactly.

## ✅ CORE CRITICAL GAME RULES

1. 🎯 Stress System (Range: 0–100)
   - Every decision affects stress (some +ve, some -ve)
   - If `stress >= 100`, trigger **Hospitalization Event**:
     - Show popup: "You’ve collapsed from overwork."
     - Freeze game progress for **3 game turns**
     - Auto-debit ₹10,000 hospital fee
     - Show stat reset: stress = 40, energy = 70

2. 💔 Emotion System (Range: 0–100)
   - Some events reduce emotion (burnout, personal loss)
   - If `emotion <= 0`, trigger **Mental Breakdown**
     - Show popup: "You lost will to continue."
     - Freeze 2 turns
     - Auto-fire one team member due to neglect
     - Emotion resets to 30

3. 💸 Bankruptcy Check
   - If `bankBalance < -100000`, trigger **Game Over**
     - Message: “You are ₹1L in debt. Financial recovery failed.”
     - Offer retry (start over) or quit

4. 📉 Reputation Logic
   - If `reputation < 10`, remove access to:
     - Investor proposals
     - High-level hires
   - Show: “Your reputation is too low to access this opportunity”

5. 😵 High Stress + Low Emotion Combo
   - If `stress >= 90` **AND** `emotion <= 10`, trigger:
     - "Blackout Mode": 1 turn skipped, ₹5000 penalty, stats frozen

## 🏥 NEW SCENARIO EVENTS (Dynamic, Based on Stats)

Implement dynamic scenario engine:
- Evaluate player stats after each turn
- If any special condition matches, **trigger matching scenario** instead of random one

Examples:

```json
{
  "trigger": "stress>=100",
  "title": "Hospital Emergency",
  "description": "You collapsed in office and woke up in ICU.",
  "options": [
    { "text": "Rest", "effects": { stress: -60, bank: -10000 } },
    { "text": "Ignore", "effects": { stress: +10, karma: -2 } }
  ]
}

Repeat for:

emotion = 0

karma < 10

bank balance < -100000

reputation < 10

burnout streak (if player plays 6 turns without break)

🔁 OLD SYSTEMS TO MAINTAIN (Previously Discussed)

✅ Wallet vs Bank Logic
✅ All FD/Bond maturity goes to Bank
✅ Wallet shows in topbar only
✅ All purchases and bills come from Bank
✅ Hire System: fix modal, promote/bonus/fire/feedback/chat
✅ Save via localStorage
✅ Team Roles (Intern → Founder) with loyalty, salary
✅ Scenario folders: Emotion, Finance, Team, Investment, etc.
✅ 200+ dynamic scenarios (folder-ready structure)
✅ Cashflow page with net flow, table, chart
✅ Toast messages for all actions
✅ Graph: Net Worth over Time
✅ Game time tracker: Months & Years
✅ Multiple Endings:

Rich: ₹1Cr+ with low stress

Balanced: ₹50L+ + Emotion > 60

Failure: Bankrupt / stress burnout

Blackout (hidden ending)

🎁 EXTRA LOGIC SUGGESTIONS (You Can Add)

1. Over-Hiring Penalty

If team size > 15, burn rate increases exponentially

Show warning: “Your team is oversized. Salaries draining cash.”



2. Investor Pull-out

If karma < 10 or bankruptcy, remove investor offer

Show: “Your ethics were questioned. Investor backed out.”



3. Team Resignations

If loyalty < 30 → member leaves

Message: "[Name] resigned due to poor leadership."



4. Auto Save every 3 turns


5. Retirement Mode

After Year 5, offer:

Sell company

Keep investing solo

Exit game with report

✅ EXPECTED OUTCOME

Every stat should dynamically affect outcomes

Burnout, stress, breakdowns feel real

Player is emotionally + financially challenged

Game loop stays realistic, growth-based, hard to exploit

Scenario engine handles 200+ files, dynamic triggers

No console error or dead buttons remain

All changes save via localStorage


Make all fixes and systems modular. Each section should work independently and smoothly. Let me test every major system live.
