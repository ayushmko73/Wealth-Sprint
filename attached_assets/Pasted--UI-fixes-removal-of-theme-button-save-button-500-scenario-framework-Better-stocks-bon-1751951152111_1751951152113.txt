🎮🧠 Prompt: Wealth Sprint — Full Game Upgrade (v5.0)


---

🔰 Project Vision:

Wealth Sprint is a financial + emotional simulation game. Player decisions affect not just money, but also karma, stress, emotions, logic, and reputation. The ultimate goal: reach Financial Independence through wise decisions and investment.

We now want to build Version 5.0, which upgrades the game from a prototype to a polished app-level experience.

✅ TASKS TO COMPLETE

[A] 🔧 UI Cleanup Tasks

1. Remove All Theme Buttons

Top bar light/dark button (moon/sun icon)
